# Tracking the history of the gov.uk domain heirarchy

.gov.uk domains are often deleted.  This means that there is no longer any registration data that
indicates when domains were active - which may be neessary for research purposes.

## gov-uk-domain-lists

These are downloads from [List of .gov.uk domain names](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-gov-uk-domain-names)
which have been modified to make processing easier

* rename to sortable filename format
* 7-bit ascii, unix-linendings
* normalised domain column - lowercased, highest level domain only
